		create databases
		list route
		login
			unprotected routes reroute to login and login reroutes to home if authenticated
		bug: login page shows 500 after login
			the login page shows a 500 error when logging out
			
			so looks like the form data is persisting when redirecting to login?
			
			not sure as to where the username password is even coming from?
		logout page
		bug: user not being found anymore
			the user is coming out as none so login doesnt think youre ever actually logged in
			
			the home page isnt showing the lists because user is none
		bug: list page is giving a 500
		delete item in list
		create item in list
		delete list for user
		create list for user
		bug: foreign keys arent restricting like theyre supposed to homie
			sqlite doesnt enfore foreign keys by default
		bug: when a session id doesnt exist, the redirects go crazy
			cleared out session cookie if a user cant be found from it, so either session
			exist or user doesnt exist
		edit item in list
		edit list for user
		account page
		create style sheet

			create the base styles for all the thingys
			
			am just going to use skeleton ui for now
		encode the session value


			made the session id a random string and added an expires_at field to filter based
			on expired or not when accessing the user
			
			probably either have a session created_at field and check with an appsetting
			for expiration 
			OR
			have the cookie be time limited
		style the login page
		create a layout for the app
			layout needs to have menu, user icon and home button
		style the home page
		style the items page
		create sign up page


			the damned thing is just disappearing??
			
			weird... apparently signup is a special route??
		hash the passwords
